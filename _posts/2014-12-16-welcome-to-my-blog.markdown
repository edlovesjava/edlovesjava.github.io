I am starting this blog to talk about the interesting technologies that I am working with, and perhaps help others along the way.

I believe in programming 'out loud'. It helps me remember all of the fun challenges I face, and HOW I SOLVED THEM. And others might benefit from my learning too.

I am using Jekyll on github.io to present this project blog.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
