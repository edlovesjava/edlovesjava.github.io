This post outlines a set of changes made to the [Ionic framework Todo example][ionicexample] to further enhance the learning and create a useful working deliverable. Since I work in places using [agile methodologies](http://agilemanifesto.org) I will make these modifications as a set of stories.

I started by following the example provided step by step (chapter 1 - 6), including installing ionic, and installing ios and android emulators as described in a [previous post][installionic].

The [ionic example][ionicexample] as described in the guide is limited to features of being able to add projects, and also tasks to projects. I have added the following features to futher enforce my learning.

Additional stories:

 * [edit a task][edittask]
 * [mark a task as done][markdone]
 * delete a task

Remaining

 * rename a project
 * remove a project

I will walk through the additions I have done.
