# Getting started with [ionic framework][ionic]

[Ionic framework][ionic] is built on [angular js](http://angularjs.org) to build apps that can be run native on android or ios devices using [cordova][cordova] to build and run as a native app.

The ionic's getting started guide walks through the steps to create the obligitory todo application that can be compiled and run natively on ios and android devices. 

I walked through the steps in installing in a [previous blog article]({% post_url 2014-12-18-install-ionic %})

My [next blog article][next] will discuss modifications I made to expand the example.
